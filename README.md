In this project, we aim to build a laptop price prediction model from a reliable data set. From there, people who want to buy a laptop can make good decision.

General step in this project:
  1. We crawl data in Amazon Website by using scrapy library - folder laptopscraper
  2. We preprocess and detect outlier in the data - Data_Preprocessing and Detect Outlier.ipynb
  3. We make some EDA on data to see characteristic of data and do feature engineering(one-hot encoding) - EDA.ipynb
  4. We build various ML regression model to predict the price of laptop based on the characteristic of laptop (RAM, ROM, CPU,....) - ML model.ipynb
  5. We make a small GUI like a demo, you can input the the characteristic of laptop and it will the prediction price for that laptop - demo.ipynb
